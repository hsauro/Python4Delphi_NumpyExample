# Python4Delphi_NumpyExample
Sample code showing how to use [Delphi4Python](https://github.com/pyscripter/python4delphi) to export a Delphi class object whose methods can be called from Python. It shows the used of Python buffers to handle numpy arrays and include both receiving numpy arrays from python as well as returning numpy arrays back to a python call. The current code depends on python 3.11 and uses the embedded python as an example. These can be easily changed to other python versions  including python installaiton aready on a users machine. Currnetly only tested on Windows. 

THis code requries the latest distribution of Delphi4Python. It will not work with the version that gets installed with Getit.
